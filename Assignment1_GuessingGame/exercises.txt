Assignment 1 Exercises

In order to start thinking a bit algorithmically, modify this file and answer the following questions. Be sure to add/commit/push any changes made to this file to our repository.


1.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses could it take to get the right number if we had no hint at all? Explain.
	
	When no hints are allowed, it could take 10 guesses to get it right in the worse case senario. Because there are 10 numbers, suppose that a guesser starts from 1 and the actual answer is 10, a linear search from one extreme to another takes 10 iterations/ guesses.


2.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses does it take to get the right number if we get a hint of 'higher or lower' when guessing numbers 1-10? *Hint* In your answer you might show this mathematically with the log function.

	In the worse case senario, it will take 4 guesses to get the right result. The number of guesses in the worse case senario corresponds to the algorithmic complexity of a binary search method.
